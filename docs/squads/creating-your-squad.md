# Creating Your Squad

![A cover image for squads](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1690467943/docs/Update%20July%202023/-_Private_squads_v3_2.png)

## What is a Squad?

A Squad is a group where you and other developers can come together to learn and interact on topics that matter to you. You can think of Squads like any other online group but geared specifically towards developers.

On Squads, you can share knowledge, ask questions, and engage in discussions, all within a group of your peers.

A Squad can be Public or Private. Public Squads are featured in the Squad Directory, anyone can join them and jump into the conversation. A Private Squad is invite only. 
Squads can center around your team, a project, a community, or anything else. It can be about a topic, a mutual goal, or just for having fun together. The possibilities are endless (but keep it clean).

## Key features of Squads

Here are some of the features that are now live as part of Squads:

✨ **Create a Squad**: Starting today, you all have the ability to create your own Squads, complete with a unique name, image, and description.

✨ **Invite your friends and colleagues**: invite developers you know and appreciate to your Squad, facilitate the discussion, manage interesting links together, and more! If it's a Public Squad, we highly recommend adding moderators to help you manage the conversation. 

✨ **Create new posts**: Depending on the settings, you can open up posting up to everyone, or moderators only. Posts can be created directly on the Squad, shared links from the daily.dev feed or external sources, enhancing interaction and discussion. Squads have full markdown support too!

✨ **Moderate Your Squad**: As an admin, you have access to moderation tools to manage posts, comments, and member interactions. Keep your Squad discussions healthy, respectful, and focused. Again, for Public Squads, we highly recommend adding another moderator, the best Squads have more than one moderator. 

## How to Create a Squad

Creating a new Squad is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Start a new Squad**: On your left sidebar, find and click the "New Squad" button, in the Directory, you'll also find a "New Squad" button on the top right. 
2. **Name your Squad**: Choose a name and handle that represents the theme or focus of your Squad.
3. **Add an Image**: You can choose to upload an image that will serve as the profile photo for your Squad. This could be a logo, an icon, or any image related to your Squad's topic.
4. **Write a Description**: Describe what your Squad is about. This is a great place to detail the main topic, what members can expect, and why they should join.

:::tip
Remember, the most vibrant Squads are those with active participation. Encourage your members to contribute, share their knowledge, and engage in discussions. With your leadership and the tools provided by daily.dev, your Squad is well on its way to becoming a dynamic and valuable community for developers.

## Squad Visibility (Private vs. Public)

You can choose the visibility of your Squad:

1. **Private Squads** : Only members can view and contribute to the Squad content. You control invitations.
2. **Public Squads** (default): Show up in the Directory. If a developer chooses to, they will join the Squad, and then posts will show up in their feed.
3. **Featured Squads** : Great Public Squads, that drive a great deal of value and engagement with clear purpose and content may become featured and enjoy increased visibility in the directory and the feed. 

Good luck! We can't wait to see you build and engage with your community ✨
